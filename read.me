# Taxi Trips in Chicago — Exploratory Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing (Sprint 8)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing taxi trip data in Chicago using Python.  
The work was divided into two main parts:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — exploring, cleaning, and visualizing datasets.  
2. **Hypothesis Testing** — testing whether weather conditions affect trip durations.

---

## Datasets
- **`project_sql_result_01.csv`**  
  *Taxi companies and number of trips (Nov 15–16, 2017).*  
  - `company_name` — taxi company  
  - `trips_amount` — number of trips  

- **`project_sql_result_04.csv`**  
  *Neighborhoods where trips ended (November 2017).*  
  - `dropoff_location_name` — Chicago neighborhood  
  - `average_trips` — average trips ending in each neighborhood  

- **`project_sql_result_07.csv`**  
  *Trips from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport.*  
  - `start_ts` — pickup timestamp  
  - `weather_conditions` — weather at trip start  
  - `duration_seconds` — trip duration in seconds

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Imported and cleaned the datasets.  
- Ensured correct data types and handled missing values.  
- Identified the **top 10 neighborhoods** with the highest average drop-offs.  
- Built visualizations:  
  - **Taxi companies vs. number of trips**  
  - **Top 10 neighborhoods by drop-offs**  
- Derived insights on demand concentration across companies and locations.

## Part 2: Hypothesis Testing
**Hypothesis:**  
*"The average duration of trips from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."*

- **Null hypothesis (H₀):** Average trip duration is the same on rainy and non-rainy Saturdays.  
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** Average trip duration differs on rainy Saturdays.  
- Selected significance level: **α = 0.05**.  
- Compared two groups: rainy Saturdays vs. non-rainy Saturdays.  
- Applied statistical testing (`t-test` or `Mann-Whitney U`, depending on normality).  
- **Conclusion:** Based on p-value, decided whether to reject or not reject H₀, and discussed the practical implications.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)  
- SciPy / Statsmodels (hypothesis testing)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Results
- The analysis highlighted the **most active taxi companies** and **top neighborhoods** in terms of drop-offs.  
- The hypothesis test provided statistical evidence on whether weather (rainy Saturdays) influences average trip duration to O’Hare.
